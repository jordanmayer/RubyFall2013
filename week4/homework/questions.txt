Chapter 11 Basic Input and Output
The Rake Gem: http://rake.rubyforge.org/

1. How does Ruby read files?
  - To read files, we can use "simple" I/O methods - calling the gets method. You can call this on an input the user should supply (like normal), or supply an external file that will be used as input.

2. How would you output "Hello World!" to a file called my_output.txt?
  
  File.open("my_output.txt", "w") { puts "Hello World!" }

  # I didn't actually test this so it may have an error, but the idea is to use File.open to create/open my_output.txt then pass the block to that file.

3. What is the Directory class and what is it used for?
  - It is a class dealing with directoies in the file system - I don't really understand beyond that. It provides ways to list directories and their contents.

4. What is an IO object?
  - And IO Object is a bidirectional channel between a Ruby program and some external resource. (It allows a Ruby program to read and write from another file/source).

5. What is rake and what is it used for? What is a rake task?
  - Rake is a simple build program with capabilities similar to make. It looks like it has many uses, though I don't understand what most are. One is to help with running tests.
